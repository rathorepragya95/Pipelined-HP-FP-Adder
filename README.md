# Pipelined-HP-FP-Adder
Verilog Code For IEEE 754 Half Precision (16 bit) Floating Point Adder
   
   This is a reduced complexity floating point adder.   
   
   
   Format for IEEE 754 HP FP:
   S    Exp     Mantissa
   15   14:10   9:0     

   Note: Number = 0 for exp=0 and mantissa=0

Stage 1: Compare the exponents and determine the amount of shifts required to align the mantissa to make the exponents equal. Then, right-shift the mantissa of the smaller exponent by the required amount (alignment).

Stage 2: Compare the two aligned mantissas and determine which is the smaller of the two. Take 2â€™s complement of the smaller mantissa if the signs of the two numbers are different. Then, add the two mantissas. (addition).

Stage 3: Determine the amount of shifts required and the corresponding direction to normalize the result (normalization-1).

Stage 4: Shift the mantissa to the required direction by the required amount. Adjust the exponent accordingly and check for any exceptional condition (normalization-2).


I'll be adding source code after May 31st 2019 due to Univeristy policies.
